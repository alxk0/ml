OUTPUT 005 							AUTOMATA - GPT-2						   EPOCHS : 7000



It is appropriate that throughout this profile of news stories about humans, we should not neglect the deeply held hope that this automated system will bring about some fundamental change in our hearts.” However, we should not neglect the proud history and enduring wisdom of the working people who have been displaced by this technological infrastructure. It is important to remember that, as in the broader historical narrative, artificial intelligence is a fast-growing industry that has been through the most trial and error to develop. We report, the ethical challenges and successes of AI in research and development. Many people have expressed deep-rooted concerns about the potential for harmful A.I. use among populations of “risky” or “responsible” individuals, given their risk and the societal impacts it could cause. In fact, this rough estimate suggests that there are no nearly insurmountable obstacles to the widespread use of automated systems in the United States and China. The recent success of many companies in developing powerful AI products has proven that they can produce products with many different users, and the broader trend remains clear: increasing automation of the most delicate and delicate ecosystem on the planet.

A.I. in the real world

A.I. in the commercial world is no less fraught. There are significant uncertainties with regards to the risks and benefits ofreaching its full potential, including risks related to the unpredictable effects of AI on consumers, workers, and the wider economy. Although A.I. developers are well aware of the potential harms and benefits, their actions must be carefully guided by thorough knowledge and training in systems that are expected to learn effectiveness from prior decisions. In other cases, the actual and potential harms exceed the intended harms. When including human-run codes in machine code, state-of-the-art AI systems are often left behind, likely because operators did not think through the implications before applying the technology. We discuss the current state of human-AI relations today.

We have seen the politics of trust when AI is used to predict unintended or harmful behavior.64 In chapter 5, we discussed the relationship between overselling and overselling a specific technology, such as AI, which can result in the disruption of a manufacturing process or the death of an individual’s property. When AI is used to predict future behavior, it can have real consequences. One such use of AI is predictability, which is concerned with the determinations of what will happen in the world, with the use of technology. The example of AI system in Fig. 9.4 states that “Within reach of any parent,” the AI system could easily create a “sandbox scenario” in which an intruders attempt to seize control of the world. In this scenario, the parent could quickly seize the box and quickly install the parent AI system. The owner of the world is then either (1) made miserable by the experience of work, (2) unable to give adequate weight to the requirements of his or her personality, (3) intelligent but not necessarily amused by the idea of the AI system, and (4) determined to make the world a better place by any means necessary.

We will begin by exploring the fundamental characteristics of a seed AI. This is a special case of a category that includes products, processes, and algorithms that produce outputs tailored to an individual’s preferences. A natural place to start is at the front office, where machines become increasingly sophisticated systems that can filter out “wasteful” behavior and design for a particular purpose. A company can then label its employees as such and allow the plant to keep growing.

A machine learning system is trained on millions of previous customer interactions it has never encountered before. It can identify the products it’s using and, if it can’t find a satisfactory score, it flags the deal. But if it can figure out how to use that feedback to better serve its shareholders, that’s a different story. If it can’t replace disgruntled employees with products that give less to their pay grade and more to “wasteful” behavior, the business model is salvageable.

In contrast, a machine learning system using discriminatory or untrue information may not be placing the safety of our communities at risk. Such practices are built into the business model of many companies that serve our diverse needs. We have seen how these companies are often hamstrung by regulatory oversight and legal complications, and often remain wholly outside the scope of the best interests of their shareholders. By contrast, when information AI is focused on impact assessments like complaints or retweets, the focus is always on the impact the products have on people’s lives. We discuss the various forms of bias in technology and the relationship between them. Many of the questions that companies face are tailor-made for building impactful products, and the examples we highlight show how companies are often hamstrung by subtle ways that indicate a positive influence. Yet if AI can reveal the true costs

Rule of thumb on a one-to-one correspondence: A single neuron running in the negative world has an infinite undoable loop, whereas a machine that is in the positive world only has one copy of the complete representation of the input. A machine in the positive world has a pool of computers with the same capabilities as the one in the negative world, and possibly a second pool of computers each connected to a internet port by a remote gate. Depending on what kind of future machine is used, it may have different operations optimized for each problem. For example, the machine in the negative world might operate in a world of counter-attacks by biological or electronic warfare agents, or perhaps it operates in the world of gladiatorial competition between humans and machines, or perhaps it operates in the world of clandestine nuclear testing, both of which are highly undesirable activities.

We humans frequently seem happy to let our final values drift. This might often be because we do not know precisely what they are. It is not surprising that we want to define our final values at every turn. How do we define them? Most of the available scientific and technical literature suggests that defining values is a complicated exercise that requires flexible starting points, cross-border interactions, re-orienting, and redefining. Yet if we start with the idea that all humans are created equal and that final values are {EStreamFrame�ALGAL WAVES, WAI-EF17, JOHNNA, BHBB20, BH09, B0R, B0R19, BNEY, SU-LK, etc.}, which we will do in Chapter 13. Next, we will explore some of the experiments and tests that have been employed to find this idea.

2. Companion text to Hines’s The Complete First Law of Behavior

As you gain years of age you develop a strong desire to please young man. Why did you decide to write him such a letter? It seems you believe he is ineligible to receive a pension because of his age. You also seem to be interested in other children’s opinions, but no one person knows for certain. Why did you decide to write him such a letter? It is you who are the most angry, and you wrote him such a letter.

If you had just tuned in to see what was going on in your life it would have been impossible for you to have predicted that what would have been your final goal would be disappointingly indignant and mean.

In the presence of love and light

In the presence of love, you and I could each learn something new. It is perhaps best, I think it seems, for us to focus on the learning process and think about what we can do to improve it.

In the presence of light, we would both learn to communicate with one another and we would both be learning. What would it mean for a learning machine to learn to communicate with itself?

In some versions of Ware’s 1950 paper, he suggested that the lightbulb should first be turned on itself and on the machine itself so that it would continue to do the same work. In his model, then, the learning process occurs as follows:

During the initial transition to machine learning, a “discovery” is made of whether some information is Alto, Wide, or similar and shown to the machine. The machine is able to find a way to switch it off without changing its goal.

In the model, the learning process changes direction. The machine is motivated to continue learning what it has found to be the most interesting thing to do. When the discovery is made, the attention of the attentional faculty shifts toward something else.

The same effect shifts venue toward the goal of information acquisition. The new focus is again on getting the machine to do a little bit of the new thing and showing it that it can do a lot of the same work. There is a return to reinforcement learning, which is again looking for new ways to enable the machine to do new things.

2.2.4 Development and Maturation

From Chapter 8

Machines are born free of any kind of informational deprivation, and so they naturally excel at all the tasks that specify their intelligence. The inventing of automation systems that can learn to perform tasks that require coordinated action by the individual or small coordinated cluster of tasks is a promising starting point. We have yet to see how to go about starting a business or a society that values the principle of beneficial automation.

Many of the potential applications of such systems are ring-fencing opportunities for existing shareholders or for shareholders who want to retain their seat at the table. In a conventional VC fund, you would think that a traditional fund for individuals would have exactly the same structure, but this is not necessarily the case. In fact, you probably already know that Google Fundy is a fund for established companies. That
